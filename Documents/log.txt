- Mustafa - Interview with customer 2

February 2, 2024 (4:00 PM - 6:06 PM) - Meeting: ITR0 (Rocco, Abdelrahman, Alex, Mustafa, Richard) 

- Went through and refined our big user stories.

- Defined our 5 user stories for our 1st big story.

- Defined 2 of our user stories for our 2nd big story.

- Assigned each group member a user story to work on.

- Took around an hour to complete itr0.

- Discussed at a meeting on Feb 5, 2024, for GUI purposes.

February 5, 2024 (7:30 PM - 8:00 PM) Meeting: APIs (Rocco, Abdelrahman)

- Discussed how to apply the API in our program.

- Ended with us concluding that we'll need to test and experiment with it.

February 9, 2024 (4:30 PM - 5:45 PM) Meeting: Structure & APIs (Rocco, Richard, Abdelrahman, Alex, Mustafa, Youwei)

- Clarified and stated which feature will be implemented and what feature each member is responsible for.

- Talking about features will be grouped in one class file.

- Discussed the results of using the API and realistically talked about how it would be implemented.

- Discussed that another API will be needed to grab the popular games.

- Discussed that implementing a GUI for our program will take a very long time due to our lack of experience. Overhauling the program to fit a better API will take some time as well. As a result, we delayed the search feature for games.
